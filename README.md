# jsRubble
A particle based 2D physics engine for the web.

[Link ](https://tommccracken.github.io/jsRubble/) to demonstration.

## About
The aim of this project is to develop a 2D particle based constrained dynamics physics engine for producing web based animations.

The dynamic behavior of different forms of matter can be approximated with various arrangements of particles and constraints. This includes single particles, flexible bodies (string/rope, cloth, jelly), pseudo rigid bodies (to-do) and fluids (to-do). The project is not intended to be used for scientific simulation/analysis.

The core elements of the physics engine are:
* A physics world, containing;
* Particles
* Constraints
* Boundaries

The physics engine, including the demonstration/documentation web page, is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the permissive open source Apache 2.0 License.

## Usage

TBA.

## Future

Things that might be developed in the future include:
- Fluids (using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)
- Particle emitters and destroyers
- Arbitrary boundaries
- Friction
- Pseudo rigid bodies
- Improved collision detection and response (particle-particle, particle-boundary)
- Particle portals
- Angle constraint
- Physics world import/export
- More sophisticated demonstration application
- Testing
- Many tidy-ups and bug fixes

NOTE: THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW PROJECT AND AS SUCH IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
