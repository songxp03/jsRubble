# jsRubble
A particle based 2D physics engine for the web.

[Link ](https://tommccracken.github.io/jsRubble/) to demonstration.

## About
The aim of this project is to develop a 2D particle based constrained dynamics physics engine for web based animations.

The dynamic behavior of different forms of matter can be approximated using various arrangements of particles, constraints and world boundaries. This includes the behavior of single particles, flexible bodies (eg string/rope, cloth, jelly), pseudo rigid bodies (to-do) and fluids (eg water). This pure particle based approach, where dynamic complexity emerges from carefully configured collections of simple elements, enables the physics engine to be relatively light weight (e.g. collision detection only needs to consider particle-particle and particle-boundary collisions).

The physics engine, including the demonstration/documentation web page, is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the permissive open source Apache 2.0 License.

The engine is not intended to be used for scientific simulation/analysis.

## Usage

TBA.

## Theory

TBA.

## Future

The following functionality may be implemented in the future:

- Angle constraints
- Arbitrary boundaries
- More efficient vector math (reduced object construction/destruction)
- More efficient fluid dynamics
- Friction
- Improved collision detection and response (particle-particle, particle-boundary)
- Improved documentation
- Additional spatial partitioning algorithms (grid, quadtree)
- Collision detection optimisation using spatial partitioning
- Pseudo rigid bodies
- Particle emitters and destroyers
- Particle portals
- Physics world import/export
